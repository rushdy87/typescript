Typescript
-----------
Types:
  - Easy way to refer to different properties and functions that a value has.
  - In the world of Typescript we hve tow different categories of types:
    1- Primitive Types: number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null.
    2- Object Types: functions, arrays, classes, objects.
  - We use types everywhere.
q1: What is a type?
answer: An shortcut to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has.
q2: In Typescript, what has a type?
answer: Any value.
q3: Why do we care about types?
answer: They give the Typescript compiler information to analyze our code for errors.

Type Annotations:
  - Type Annotations => Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value that a variable can refers to.
  - Type inference => Typescript try to figure out what type of value that a variable can refers to.
  - Typescript can try to guess at the type of a variable based on what you assign to it.
  - we use Type Annotations in trhee scenarios: (variables.ts line 45)
    1- When the function return the 'Any' type, and we need to clarify the value.
    2- When we declare a variable on one line, then initialze it later.
    3- When we want a variable o have a type that cann't be inferred.

Any Type:
  - A type just like a "string" or "boolean".
  - Means TS has no idia what this is.
  - Avoid variables with "Any" at all costs.
Fixing Any type:
  - add type Annotation.
